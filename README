This set of scripts is designed to allow Django apps to use Stanford WebAuth without actually having to have WebAuth
installed on the local server. The script uses hashing with symmetric keys (which must be kept secret for security)
to make sure a user has been validated on the remote end.

This request allows a developer to use standard Django authorization means - including the @login_required decorator,
standard user account control for permissions, etc., to authorize users, and uses a script located on a remote server
to basically provide the login services.

The middleware is setup to automatically create user accounts for anyone who logs into the site with an SUID. If this
is not desired behavior (e.g., you want a site to be closed to approved users, and no one else can login), you'll have
to change the middleware so that it does not auto-create user accounts, or alternatively give your subset of authorized
users a specific privilege that is basically "global site privilege".

Installation:
    - Choose a SHARED_SECRET and put that in the webauth-host/wa-authenticate.php script
    - Install the wa-authenticate.php script in a Stanford WWW cgi-bin directory (you'll have to request this from
      Stanford, and you'll have to put it in the cgi-bin root)
    - Make sure you add the .htaccess file (rename to .htaccess)
    - Edit your Django settings to add:
        INSTALLED_APPS = ( ... 'webauth' ...)
        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = ( ... 'webauth.middleware.WebauthMiddleware' ...)
        SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE = True
        WEBAUTH_SHARED_SECRET = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
        WEBAUTH_URL = 'https://www.stanford.edu/~(YOUR USER ACCOUNT)/cgi-bin/wa-authenticate.php'
    - Remove the standard Django auth middleware.
    - Important: if you are in a production environment, DO NOT install wa-authenticate-test.php, and DO NOT install
      your shared secret into that script; otherwise, malicious users can use that script to login as anyone!

Typical request cycle:
    - User requests protected on the Django site
    - Request is caught in a decorator, and passed to the login action
    - Login action redirects to the hosted PHP script
    - Hosted PHP script redirects to WebAuth
    - WebAuth redirects back to the hosted PHP script, giving us the info we seek (and it's impossible to forge, or WebAuth is broken)
    - Hosted PHP script redirects back to Django server with the hashed information
    - Django server checks hash with shared secret, and logs user in if they're all cool.

TODO:
    - Support LDAP user access group passing (i.e. suPrivilegeGroup and suAffiliation)
    - Support arbitrary LDAP data passing (data is very limited by Stanford www-data user privileges)
